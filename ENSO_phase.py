"""
This script applies ENSO classification by identifying all 3-month seasons that are part of any 5 consecutive overlapping 3-month periods
meeting the ONI threshold (≥ +0.5°C for El Niño, ≤ –0.5°C for La Niña). Each season is classified as EN or LN if it lies within any such window.
Classification relies solely on ONI values (rounded to 1 decimal to align with CPC visual summaries) and does not consider atmospheric coupling.
ONI data was downloaded from: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/oni.ascii.txt

Created April 2025
Updated: Dual-directional + inclusion logic + CPC-style rounding
